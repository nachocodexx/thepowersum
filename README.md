# The power sum

This is a simple solution for the power sum problem using Typescript.

## Getting Started

We need install all the dependencies for the project

```
yarn install
or
npm install
```

### Prerequisites

```
- Install node & npm
- Install all dependencies
```

### Running test

```
yarn test
```

```
yarn start:dev
```

### Production mode

This command transpile the index.ts and we get bundle.js inside of dist folder
